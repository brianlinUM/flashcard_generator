* MHacks 12 Hackathon project
* Team members: Victor Fu, Brian Lin, Alan Tran, Shayne
* Project Features:
  * Use Google Cloud's Natural Language Processing to analyse text materials for keywords. Keywords are evaluated using the salience score, a measure of the word's importance relative to the rest of the text passage.
  * Randomly remove from a list of N-most-salient keywords from the text and generate fill-in-the-blank quiz flashcards as PDF.
  * Hosted a live demo web application using Flask. Originally hosted on a Google Compute Engine VM.
